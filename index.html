          <h3>1879</h3>
          <p class="year-description">
            Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom
            of Württemberg in the German Empire. His birth marked the beginning
            of the life of one of the most influential physicists in history.

          <h3>1905</h3>
          <p class="year-description">
            In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers in the
            Annalen der Physik, which revolutionized physics. These papers laid
            the foundation for modern physics and introduced concepts such as
            the special theory of relativity, the photoelectric effect, and the
            famous equation E=mc².

          <h3>1915</h3>
          <p class="year-description">
            In 1915, Einstein completed his general theory of relativity, which
            provided a new understanding of gravity. This theory proposed that
            gravity is not just a force between objects with mass, as described
            by Newtonian physics, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by
            mass and energy.

          <h3>1921</h3>
          <p class="year-description">
            Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his
            explanation of the photoelectric effect, which was described in one
            of his 1905 papers. This achievement solidified his reputation as
            one of the greatest physicists of his time.

          <h3>1933</h3>
          <p class="year-description">
            With the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany, Einstein, who was of
            Jewish descent, emigrated to the United States in 1933. He settled
            in Princeton, New Jersey, where he continued his work in theoretical
            physics and became a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study.
